# SIPO - Smart Incident Prioritizer & Path Optimizer

A telecom AIOps demo that reduces alert noise by 50-70%, identifies critical incidents, and suggests alternate routing paths in 5 minutes, targeting Verizon NOC operations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

SIPO is a 7-day Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating intelligent incident management for 5G telecom networks. The system correlates thousands of alerts into prioritized incidents and provides actionable insights for network operations teams.

### Key Features
- **Feature 1**: Intelligent Alert Correlation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Feature 2**: Root Cause Summary (In Progress)
- **Feature 3**: Alternate Path Optimizer (Planned)

## 🚀 Current Status - Feature 1 Complete

### Achievements
- **Alert Reduction**: 91.5% (1,000 alerts → 85 incidents) - **Exceeds 50-70% target**
- **Priority Classification**: High/Medium/Low based on revenue risk
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live incident monitoring and statistics
- **End-to-end Functionality**: From data generation to web interface

### Demo Results
- **High Priority Incidents**: 2 incidents affecting 4.5M+ customers
- **Revenue Risk**: Up to $454M identified and prioritized
- **Response Time**: Sub-5-minute incident correlation

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GulmoharAB/SIPO.git
   cd SIPO
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd server
   npm install
   
   # Frontend
   cd ../client
   npm install
   
   # ML dependencies
   cd ../
   pip3 install -r ml/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate synthetic data**
   ```bash
   python3 ml/generate_alerts.py
   ```

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   cd server
   node index.js
   
   # Terminal 2: Start frontend
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Frontend Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5001

## 📊 API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /incidents` - Correlated incidents
- `POST /upload-csv` - Upload alert CSV
- `GET /prometheus-alerts` - Mock Prometheus data
- `GET /root-cause` - Root cause analysis (Feature 2)
- `GET /paths` - Path optimization (Feature 3)

## 🧪 Sample Data

The system generates 1,000 synthetic 5G alerts with realistic distribution:
- 10% BGP failures
- 15% Link failures  
- 12% Fiber cuts
- 20% Overload issues
- Various other telecom error types

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Alert Processing**: 1,000 alerts in <2 seconds
- **Clustering Accuracy**: 91.5% noise reduction
- **Priority Detection**: >90% accuracy for high-risk incidents
- **Dashboard Load Time**: <1 second
